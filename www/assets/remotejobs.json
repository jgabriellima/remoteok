We communicate primarily through chat (Slack) and issue tracking (JIRA), as needed over phone (Slack, join.me and similar, Skype, etc.) and we meet up once in a month in person for a day or two \u00e2\u0080\u0093 usually in London.\nYou can use any OS\/IDE\/editor you like \u00e2\u0080\u0093 whatever makes you productive.

We have devs running Windows, OS X and Linux.\nWhat we are looking for\n-----------------------\nYou should be\n- a good communicator. You are able to understand others and explain yourself clearly and concisely. You know how to chase the best ideas in a discussion, not just push your own.\n- proactive and motivated. You're comfortable asking for help when you're stuck; you make constructive suggestions when you see something that could be working better.\n- able to prioritize well. You can strike the right balance between hacking things together hastily and completely disappearing for two months while refactoring the persistence layer. You understand both the technical priorities and the business priorities underpinning them.\n- conscious of risk. You have seen successful and failed projects, and you have a good sense of what is going to work and what is going to fail.\n- able to deliver working, production-quality code.\nTasks\n-----\nWe have all kinds of interesting stuff to work on -- after a few weeks or months of general feature tasks, you will find the role that suits you most. Some of us ended up working on site reliability, others drifted towards the front end \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it really depends on you.

You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll also have the opportunity to attend a weeklong official Holacracy training event at our expense.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>We also practice Open Book Management, meaning that we share the exact details of our Balance Sheet and P&amp;L Statement with our entire team in real-time, ensuring that our staff has the data they need to treat the business as if it were their own.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Our team members work from home and choose their own hours, allowing them to make time for family, recreation, vacations, or anything that is important to them.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Every team member gets 10 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20 paid time off days intended to be used for vacations. Go have fun.

We try to do these meetings in cities that are fun to visit. In the last few years, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been to Austin, Orlando, Minneapolis, San Diego, Las Vegas, New York City, and Detroit.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>As you might expect from a company that is so open, we also post our salary information right here in the job post.

We want your family to be healthy.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>We recognize that other companies may offer higher initial salary offers or signing bonuses, but at Action Verb, we know that for our ideal candidate, the exact level of pay is just one criteria by which they choose where to work. Our goal is to offer the greatest work environment possible and pay people well enough to make it possible for them to join the team. Come learn our way of working, take on as many roles as you can, and establish yourself as a valuable asset to us. Then after your first year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll re-evaluate your salary and make sure it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more than fair, given the value you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been able to generate for the company.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>We are looking for candidates who bring the following skills to the table:<\/div><div><br><\/div><ul><li>Significant experience working with GNU\/Linux servers, including a complete understanding of the command line, \/proc, services, etc.<br><\/li><li>Comprehensive understanding of networking concepts, including layers, firewalls, DNS, VPN, etc.<br><\/li><li>Proficiency with configuration management tools, such as Chef or Puppet, and fluency with at least one major scripting language.<br><\/li><li>Experience building distributed, failure-resistant architecture, including disaster recovery, backups, failover, etc.<br><\/li><li>Experience with the advanced featured of public cloud platforms such as AWS or Azure (we use AWS).<br><\/li><li>Familarity with large scale monitoring and analysis systems, such as ELK or Splunk (we use ELK).<br><\/li><li>Complete understanding of how to build secure infrastructure and an awareness of common server security vulnerabilities.<br><\/li><li>Ability to manage a large database at scale (we use MySQL).<br><\/li><li>History developing and supporting actual infrastructure that has seen production usage at equal to or greater than our scale.

Our best applicants also tend to have at least 3-5 years experience in a position with direct responsibility for supporting large production deployments.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>We believe that everyone in the company should have programming skills. Our customers are primarily engineers, and in order to relate to them and support our products at the highest possible level, we should all be engineers too. As a Sysadmin\/DevOps engineer, you will spend a lot of time writing code here.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>We believe that the best Engineers tend to be polyglots with a wide variety of programming language experience. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care whether you specifically know Puppet or Chef, but we look for engineers who are fluent in several programming languages.

When our product changes, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be the point of contact for our customers via email, in product announcements, phone calls and (occasional) in-person visits.\n\n\nAbout You\n\nJoining our team means you enjoy a fast-paced and ever changing work environment. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re fearless and relish in big challenges, working within the grey and making it concrete and clear. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re entrepreneurial, you love developing relationships with others and helping them solve complex problems -- all with the ease of a trapeze artist! You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a digital maven and love interacting with customers through email, in-product, and sometimes over the phone.  Because Expensify is a simple product that connects to a variety of deceptively complex financial systems, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also someone who is comfortable wading in the complicated waters of accounting and simplifying it for our customers.\n\nFor the best possible fit, we are looking for someone who can:\n\n- Deftly articulate complex thoughts. One moment you may be having a technical discussion with an engineer about the product implications of a new feature, before quickly moving on to working directly with a non-technical customer to fix a problem. The ideal candidate will be able to clearly articulate themselves in each scenario.\n- Maintain customer relationships and problem solve on their behalf by providing clear and friendly written (and verbal) communication.\n- Manage time and prioritize efficiently. Things move quickly in this environment and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crucial that you are able to react to new information and re-prioritize accordingly.\n- Learn from peers across teams in an informal fashion. After all, no one is an expert at Expensify and we're all learning things as we go. We also love anyone who's able to effectively train colleagues as we grow the team.\n- Do what it takes to bring the most value to the company day to day, even if it may be sometimes repetitive and not so glamorous. #oneteamonedream\n- Support customers day in and day out, with the understanding that a product-driven company grows nowhere without a happy customer base. Make no mistake, this role is squarely grounded in support, no matter the customer size.\n- Say \u00e2\u0080\u009cno\u00e2\u0080\u009d and communicate that things won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always change \u00e2\u0080\u009cnow\u00e2\u0080\u009d. This helps to keep our product simple and user-friendly, but it is only possible with in-depth product knowledge and a deep understanding of the problem that the customer is trying to solve.\n- Bonus: Some general understanding of the accounting process, Not required!\n","url":"https:\/\/remoteok.io\/jobs\/23516-remote-success-coach-expensify"},{"slug":"23514-remote-software-engineer-rails-healthify","id":"23514","epoch":"1494437762","date":"2017-05-10T10:36:02-07:00","company":"Healthify","position":"Software Engineer (Rails)","tags":["ruby","engineer","dev","digital nomad"],"logo":"https:\/\/we-work-remotely-production.imgix.net\/logos\/0001\/5953\/logo.gif","description":"<div><h2 class='section__header'>Description<\/h2><\/div><div>Our mission is to build a world where no one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health is hindered by their need.
